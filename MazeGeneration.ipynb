In this project, we will be using Python 3, and the default GUI library for Python, Tkinter.

    "Congrats! We've just implemented a basic model for a single vertex in our graph! Looking at the Node class above may still be a little confusing, so let's clarify a few things up:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. What are self.\\_\\_north, self.\\_\\_south, self.\\_\\_east, self.\\_\\_west?\n",
    "    * self.\\_\\_XXXXX variables are private instance variables -- variables that all Node object inherently have. We could have just as easily defined them as self.north, self.south, etc., however, that would allow anything outside of the Node class we just created to access and modify the instance variables. By appending '\\_\\_' before the variable name, we've made the instance variables private, meaning only the Node object can make calls to self.\\_\\_XXXXX. We create north, south, east, and west instance variables because we will be creating a [grid graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph). We could go into the mathematical definition of a lattice graph to describe a grid graph, but for the sake of this tutorial, we just need to understand that in a grid graph, all verteces are connected by at most four edges and have no diagonal connections, which creates an $(n \\times m)$ structure that looks like a rectangular grid of width $n$ and height $m$.\n",
    "  2. What is 'None'?\n",
    "    * 'None' is Python's null constant. Described in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html), None is the \"sole value of the type `NoneType`. `None` is frequently used to represent the absence of a value\" (2017). We set the above instance variables to 'None', simply because we don't know what will be north, south, east, or west of the newly created Node (or if there even will be anything).\n",
    "  3. What are '@property' and '@XXXXX.setter'?\n",
    "    * Using '@property' allows for access of private instance variables outside of the Node class, while '@XXXXX.setter' allows for setting the value of 'XXXXX' outside of the Node class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've caught it by now, having the '.setter' for the north, south, east, and west variables seems a little insecure, since they can be changed after the graph has been created. Since this could potentially ruin the model of our grid graph, let's fix that. For every directional setter method, add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if self.__XXXXX is None:\n",

    "@north.setter\n",
    "def north(self, north):\n",
    "    if self.__north is None:\n",
    "        self.north = north\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
